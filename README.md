# Fish shell functions

I love fish shell and I want to create something about that.

## Functions

> Just put the functions at fish shell functions directory, and then you can use those functions.

- ghome

This function can open a github repo's homepage quickly.And if current directory is not a github repo,exit and echo a message about the reason.

## Others

...Just for fun...
